# Raw Sockets

## Background

This Network Sockets API proposal relates to the Discourse post [Filling the remaining gap between WebSocket, WebRTC and WebTransport](https://discourse.wicg.io/t/filling-the-remaining-gap-between-websocket-webrtc-and-webtranspor/4366).

## Use cases

The initial motivating use case is to support creating a web app that talks to servers and devices that have their own protocols incompatible with whatâ€™s available on the web. The web app should be able to talk to a legacy system, without requiring users to change or replace that system.

- [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol)
- [printer protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_printing_protocols)
- [industrial electronic devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus)
- Mail
- [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat)
- [IOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) smart devices
- [Distributed Hash Tables for P2P systems](https://discourse.wicg.io/t/filling-the-remaining-gap-between-websocket-webrtc-and-webtranspor/4366/3)
- [Resilient collaboration using IPFS](https://discourse.wicg.io/t/filling-the-remaining-gap-between-websocket-webrtc-and-webtranspor/4366/5)

## Alternatives

Web apps can already establish data communications using [XMLHttpRequest](https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/), [WebSocket](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/web-sockets.html) and [WebRTC](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/).

These facilities are designed to be tightly constrained ([example design requirements](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2008Jun/0165.html)), and don't allow raw TCP or UDP communication. Such facilities were [requested](https://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2008-September/058530.html) but not provided due to the potential for abuse.

If the web server has network access to the required server or device, it can act as relay. For example, a web mail application might use XMLHttpRequest for communication between the browser and the web server, and use SMTP and IMAP between the web server and a mail server.

In scenarios like the following, a vendor would require their customers to deploy a relay web server on each site where devices/servers are in use:
- The target devices might be behind firewalls, not accessible to a central server.
- Communication might be bandwidth-intensive or latency-sensitive.
- There might be legal constraints on where data can be sent.
- On-site communication may need to be resilient to ISP outages.

Developers have used browser plugins - such as Java applets, ActiveX, [Adobe Flex](https://www.adobe.com/au/products/flex.html) or [Microsoft Silverlight](https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/) - to establish raw TCP or UDP communication from the browser, without relaying through a web server.

With the shift away from browser plugins, native apps now provide the main alternative. Widely used APIs include [POSIX sockets](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/sys_socket.h.html), [Winsock](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/winsock-functions), [java.net](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/package-summary.html) and [System.Net.Sockets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.sockets).

## Security Considerations

User agents will need to carefully consider when to make the Raw Sockets API available to web applications,
and what UI will be shown to the user.

## TCP

Applications will be able to request a TCP socket using a method on `navigator`:

```javascript
const options = {
    remoteAddress: 'example.com',
    remotePort: 7,
    keepAlive: false,
    noDelay: false
};
navigator.openTCPSocket(options).then(tcpSocket => { ... }).else(error => { ... });
```

The `remoteAddress` member may be omitted or ignored - the user agent may invite the user to specify the address.

The TCP socket can be used for reading and writing:

```
let readableStream = tcpSocket.readable;
let writableStream = tcpSocket.writable;
...
tcpSocket.close();
```

## UDP
